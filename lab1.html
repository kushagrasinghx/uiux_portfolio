                    <p> Image: Image is a representation of the external form of a person or thing in art that can
                        be displayed with the help of a computer. A computer image is a picture composed of an
                        array of elements called pixels.<br><br>
                        Types of Images: There are several types of images that are used in computer graphics
                        on daily basis such as:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>JPEG/JPG</li>
                            <li>PNG</li>
                            <li>AVIF</li>
                            <li>GIF</li>
                            <li>WebP</li>
                            <li>SVG and many more.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Raster Images: The images that are constructed with the help of pixels are called Raster
                        Images. The quality of the image is changed when the number of pixels in the image are
                        changed. The common tool for Raster Image generation is Adobe Photoshop.<br><br>
                        Vector Images: The images that are constructed through lines, curves and fills are called
                        vector images. Vector images are resolution independent and the image quality does not
                        change when the image is zoomed in or out. Vector images can be exported as an Raster
                        Image in any resolution. The common tool for Vector Image generation is Adobe Illustrator.<br><br>
                        Color Model: Color model is the way in which we can specify or describe a color
                        numerically. Some of the common examples of color models are:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RGB</li>
                            <li>sRGB</li>
                            <li>HSV</li>
                            <li>CMYK</li>
                        </ul>
                        Pixel: A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image or graphic that can be displayed and
                        represented on a digital display device.<br><br>
                        Resolution: The resolution of the image is described as the sharpness or clarity of an
                        image or picture. It is expressed in terms of the number of pixels that can be displayed
                        both horizontally and vertically. For example:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HD Resolution of a Monitor: 1280x720</li>
                            <li>FullHD Resolution of a Monitor: 1920x1080</li>
                        </ul>
                        The resolution is written as pixel x pixel format. Where both the numbers show the length
                        and the width of the image or video or any screen that can be measured in terms of pixels.<br><br>
                        DPI: DPI stands for Dots Per Inch. It is a measure of spatial printing, video or image
                        scanner dot intensity. The more the DPI, the better the quality. Modern mouse also has an
                        option to change the DPI scaling according to the screen resolution it is used on.<br><br>
                        Video: Video is a recording of an image or moving images. Videos are the compilation
                        of various images referred to as frames with a playing audio in background. Frames Per
                        Second is a unit of measurement of the number of images that will be displayed per
                        second. The standard frame rate is 24 fps or 30 fps. More the fps of the video, smoother
                        the content.<br><br>
                        Types of Videos: There are several types of video formats that provide best quality in
                        small file sizes.Some of them are listed below:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MP4 (Most Common)</li>
                            <li>MOV</li>
                            <li>AVI</li>
                            <li>MKV</li>
                            <li>FLV and many more.</li>
                        </ul>
                        HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup
                        language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML
                        consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the
                        content.<br><br>
                        Hypertext: Hypertext is the text which contains links to other texts.

                        AR: AR stands for Augmented Reality. The digital content from the virtual world on top
                        of the real environment, providing information. Augmented Reality can be experienced
                        using our mobile devices with the help of various applications.<br><br>
                        VR: VR stands for Virtual Reality. The immersive virtual environments shout out the real
